# SRT Subtitle Reminder

_Description: This mini project consists of a SRT subtitle file which can be used to remind one of various excercises during watching a movie. Its original intention is to remind one of doing [Kegel Excercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise)._

## How to use it

_Written for non-nerds_ 

1. Download [this file](https://github.com/stnwbr/srt-subtitle-reminder/blob/master/subtitle-reminder.srt) (right click -> save as...) to your computer
2. Open the movie you want to watch in a videoplayer which supports the use of SRT subtitles, e.g. [VLC Player](http://videolan.org)
3. Open the subtitle file. This often works via drag and drop, or in VLC also via 'Video -> Subtitles Track -> Open File...'

Alternatively you can also rename the subtitle file according to your movie file, so when the movie is called 'movie.avi', rename the subtitle file to 'movie.srt'. When those two files are placed in the same folder, most movie players automatically assiciate the subtitle file.

## Background

I created this little helper for my personal Kegel excercises and share it regularely with students of Tantra workshops. 
Kegel excercises are incredibly useful for sexual health and performance and worth trying out.

## How to customize the message

Simply open the .srt file with a text editor and 'search and replace' the current 'SQUEEZE!' text. As I said, it's a really simple project :)
